## How to Play

The objective is to clear a rectangular board containing hidden "mines" without detonating any of them, with help from clues about the number of neighboring mines in each field.

### Controls

- **Left-click**: Reveal a tile. If it's a mine, the game is over.
- **Right-click**: Flag a tile where you believe a mine is located.
- **Replay**: Restart the game with the same settings.
- **Custom Level**: Set a custom number of rows, columns, and mines.

## Game Levels

There are four game levels:

- **Beginner**: 8x8 grid with 10 mines.
- **Intermediate**: 16x16 grid with 40 mines.
- **Expert**: 24x24 grid with 99 mines.
- **Custom**: Customize the grid size and number of mines.

### Key Files:

1. **main.py**: The main entry point that initializes the game.
2. **grid.py**: Contains functions to create and manage the game grid.
3. **levels.py**: Handles different game levels, including beginner, intermediate, expert, and custom levels.
